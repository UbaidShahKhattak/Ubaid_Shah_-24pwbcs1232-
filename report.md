# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to set up Visual Studio Code and Git for web development. 
I understood how Git works as a version control system and how it helps track changes in files. 
I practiced creating files, adding them to the repository, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub. 
I also learned how to create branches, switch between them, and merge them into the main branch. 
This lab helped me understand how developers manage and organize their projects using Git and GitHub.
